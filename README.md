## :star: My Work

#### Hardware E-commerce
This was a group project, fully developed under Agil Methodologies, built during 4 one week sprints and using Trello for task managment. I created server routes, complex Sequelize queries, and helped integrate a payment platform provided by Mercado Pago. I also created front end React-Redux  Components for several sections.

#### Country Explorer
This website was built using React-Redux for the front end and Nodejs, Express and Sequelize for the back end. Country info is fetch from an external API and loaded to the Data Base. I implemented backend filtering as well as front end filtering and pagination for educational purposes.
