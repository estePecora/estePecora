## Hello World! I'm Estefania! :raising_hand:

### Full Stack developer :zap: I enjoy finding creative solutions
I never outgrew childhood curiosity; I’m always asking 'why' and 'how' about everything. That’s how I ended up taking my first steps in programming, and eventually I realized it combined lots of the things I love: technology, creative thinking, and the fact you are always learning something new. So I decided to pursue it as a new career path.<br/>
This desition came as no suprise for me, since I’ve always had been interested in science and technology, I began my studies both in engineering and design, but as I started working I had to focus on one and decided to go with design.<br/>
As a former Ad creative, I’ve worked with cross-platform teams, and many clients. I overall enjoy working with brands or companies that have social impact. I have an analytic mind and I’m a fast learner. If you like my profile leave me a message! :smile:

## :star: My Work

#### Hardware E-commerce
This was a group project, fully developed under Agil Methodologies, built during 4 one week sprints and using Trello for task managment. I created server routes, complex Sequelize queries, and helped integrate a payment platform provided by Mercado Pago. I also created front end React-Redux  Components for several sections.

#### Country Explorer
This website was built using React-Redux for the front end and Nodejs, Express and Sequelize for the back end. Country info is fetch from an external API and loaded to the Data Base. I implemented backend filtering as well as front end filtering and pagination for educational purposes.
